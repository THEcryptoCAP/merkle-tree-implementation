# merkle-tree-implementation

Merkle Patricia Trie is one of the key data structures for the Ethereum’s storage layer. I wanted to understand how exactly it works. So I did a deep research on all the materials I could find and implemented the algorithm myself.

In this block post, I’ll share what I have learned. Explain how exactly Merkle Patricia Trie works, and show you a demo of how a merkle proof is generated and verified.
